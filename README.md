# Industrialization of a Data Science Project, creating a cloud infrastructure on Azure.
Project to upload Data from a SQL server to the cloud for a industrial supply provide, to then create Machine Learning Models to understand trends, and behaviors of the clients.

# First thing first
## The Problem
The Company lack on knowledge about their clients shopping behaviour, also the information is hard to use, bacause in locate in a transact database.

## Arquitecture

The idea was pull to the information from the server of the company, save it, make some cleaning, and then start using it to create a machine learning models that understand better the client and other model that predict the sales of the company. Finally show the key findings on a business intelligence board.

## Infrastructure as Code

To make more easy the use of this work, we create some Json file, that can be used to deploy automatically the architecture need it to run this project.

## The Model
To have a better understanding of the client, It's need to made a segmentation of the clients.

## Results

We present the results of the model on a BI Board.
