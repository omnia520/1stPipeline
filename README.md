The idea was pull to the information from the server of the company, save it, make some cleaning, and then start using it to create a machine learning models that understand better the client and other model that predict the sales of the company. Finally show the key findings on a business intelligence board.

## Infrastructure as Code

To make more easy the use of this work, we create some Json file, that can be used to deploy automatically the architecture need it to run this project.
